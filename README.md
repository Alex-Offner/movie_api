# Description

  <p>
    This web application will provide access to information about different
    movies, their directors and genres. You will find a list of actors and the movies they played in.
    You will be able to sign up and create
    a list of your favourite movies. Since this is only the back-end part of the app no demonstration will be available.

    Check in again soon, to see the full project.
